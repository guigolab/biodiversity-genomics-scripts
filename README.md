# biodiversity-genomics-scripts
A bunch of scripts to retrieve gff3 data (NCBI and Ensembl)


## get_ncbi_annotations

this script takes the path of a file containing the list of assembly accessions as input (/n-separated) and the output file path and outputs a tsv file containing the NCBI FTP server path of the matched assemblies
